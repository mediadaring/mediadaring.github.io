                                            The Fox and The Cat
One day a cat and a fox were having a conversation. The fox, who was a conceited creature, boasted how clever she was. ‘Why, I know at least a hundred tricks to get away from our mutual enemies, the dogs,’ she said.
‘I know only one trick to get away from dogs,’ said the cat. ‘You should teach me some of yours!’
‘Well, maybe some day, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones,’ replied the fox airily.
Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder – the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. ‘This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,’ she called down to the fox. ‘Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?’
The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived. They fell upon the fox and tore her to pieces.

                                            The Fox and The Cat One day a cat and a fox were having a conversation. The fox, who was a conceited creature, boasted how clever she was. ‘Why, I know at least a hundred tricks to get away from our mutual enemies, the dogs,’ she said. ‘I know only one trick to get away from dogs,’ said the cat. ‘You should teach me some of yours!’ ‘Well, maybe some day, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones,’ replied the fox airily. Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder – the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. ‘This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,’ she called down to the fox. ‘Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?’ The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived. They fell upon the fox and tore her to piece*Tolong tuliskan passive voice nya*...​</a>

The cat said, “I hate hounds. They are very nasty animals. They hunt and kill us”.
The fox said, “I hate hounds more than you”. .
The cat asked, “How do you save yourself from hounds?”
The fox replied, “There are many tricks to get away from hounds”.
The cat asked “Can you say what your tricks are?”
“They are very simple”, said the fox. He added, “I can hide behind thick bushes. I can run along thorny hedges. I can hide in burrows. There are many more such tricks”.
Now it was the turn of the fox to ask the cat about her tricks.
The fox asked, “How many tricks do you know?”
The cat replied, “I know just one trick”.
The Fox sneered, “Oh! How sad! You know only one trick? What is your trick?”
The cat was about to answer. But, she found a flock of hounds fast approach. She said, “I am going to do it now. Because the hounds are coming”.
Saying these words, the cat ran up a nearby tree safe from the hounds. The fox tried all his tricks but the hounds out beat him. “My one trick is better than all his tricks”, said the cat to herself.

                                            The Fox and The Cat
One day a cat and a fox were having a conversation. The fox, who was a conceited creature, boasted how clever she was. ‘Why, I know at least a hundred tricks to get away from our mutual enemies, the dogs,’ she said.
‘I know only one trick to get away from dogs,’ said the cat. ‘You should teach me some of yours!’
‘Well, maybe some day, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones,’ replied the fox airily.
Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder – the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. ‘This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,’ she called down to the fox. ‘Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?’
The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived. They fell upon the fox and tore her to pieces.

 Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder - the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. "This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know," she called down to the fox. "Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?"
 the fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived, They fell upon the fox and tore her to pieces.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The resolution of the story "The Fox and the Grapes" can be interpreted in a few different ways. One common resolution is that the fox eventually becomes frustrated and gives up on trying to reach the high-hanging grapes. After several failed attempts, the fox convinces itself that the grapes are not worth the effort or are undesirable. Thus, it walks away feeling satisfied with itself and chooses to leave without regret.</p><p></p><p>Another possible resolution could depict a change in the fox's attitude. Initially desiring the grapes intensely, the fox eventually comes to terms with the fact that it cannot attain them. This could teach a lesson about dealing with disappointment and learning to find contentment with what is available.</p><p></p><p>However, it's important to remember that "The Fox and the Grapes" is a classic fable with multiple interpretations and moral lessons that can be derived from it. The chosen resolution depends on the perspective and the intended message of the story for the reader or listener.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Cerita "The Fox and the Grapes" memiliki beberapa resolusi yang mungkin dapat diambil. Salah satu resolusi yang umum adalah bahwa si rubah (fox) akhirnya merasa putus asa karena tidak bisa mencapai anggur (grapes) yang tergantung tinggi di atasnya. Setelah beberapa kali mencoba dan gagal, si rubah akhirnya berpikir bahwa anggur tersebut tidaklah enak atau tidak sebanding dengan usahanya. Dengan demikian, ia merasa puas dengan dirinya sendiri dan memilih untuk berjalan pergi tanpa rasa penyesalan.</p><p></p><p>Resolusi lainnya bisa saja menggambarkan perubahan sikap si rubah yang awalnya menginginkan anggur dengan sangat, tetapi akhirnya menerima kenyataan bahwa ia tidak bisa mendapatkannya. Ini bisa mengajarkan pelajaran tentang mengatasi kekecewaan dan belajar merasa puas dengan apa yang ada.</p><p></p><p>Namun, penting untuk diingat bahwa "The Fox and the Grapes" adalah cerita fabel klasik yang memiliki banyak interpretasi dan pesan moral yang dapat diambil. Resolusi yang dipilih tergantung pada sudut pandang dan tujuan cerita yang ingin disampaikan kepada pembaca atau pendengar.</p><br />

Sang Bangau dengan senang menerima undangan dari sang Rubah dan datang pada siang hari itu.<br /><br />Untuk makan siang, sang Rubah menyiapkan sup yang disajikan pada piring yang sangat ceper dan hampir datar, sehingga sang Bangau tidak bisa menikmati sup tersebut, hanya ujung paruhnya saja yang bisa menyentuh air sup. Tak setetes sup yang bisa di minumnya, sedangkan sang Rubah menjilati sup tersebut dengan gampangnya sambil tertawa-tawa hingga sang Bangau menjadi sangat kecewa karena telah dipermainkan.<br /><br />Sang Bangau yang lapar dan merasa tidak senang, tetap berusaha untuk tenang. Lalu kemudian sang Bangau balas mengundang sang Rubah untuk makan siang keesokan hari di rumahnya.<br /><br />Keesokan hari, tepat pada saat makan siang, sang Rubah tiba di rumah sang Bangau yang menyediakan ikan yang sangat lezat sebagai menunya, tetapi ikan tersebut di sajikan dalam sebuah guci tinggi yang mempunyai mulut guci yang sempit. Sang Bangau dengan gampang memakan ikan tersebut dengan paruhnya yang panjang sedangkan sang Rubah hanya bisa menjilati pinggiran guci sambil mencium lezatnya makanan yang tersaji. Saat sang Rubah menjadi marah, dengan tenangnya sang Bangau berkata:<br /><br />Jangan mempermainkan orang karena kamu sendiri pasti tidak suka untuk dipermainkan.<br />

                            24. A cat and a fox were once discussing about hounds.
The cat said, “I hate hounds. They are very nasty animals. They hunt and kill us”.
The fox said, “I hate hounds more than you”. .
The cat asked, “How do you save yourself from hounds?”
The fox replied, “There are many tricks to get away from hounds”.
The cat asked “Can you say what your tricks are?”
“They are very simple”, said the fox. He added, “I can hide behind thick bushes. I can run along thorny hedges. I can hide in burrows. There are many more such tricks”.
Now it was the turn of the fox to ask the cat about her tricks.
The fox asked, “How many tricks do you know?”
The cat replied, “I know just one trick”.
The Fox sneered, “Oh! How sad! You know only one trick? What is your trick?”
The cat was about to answer. But, she found a flock of hounds fast approach. She said, “I am going to do it now. Because the hounds are coming”.
Saying these words, the cat ran up a nearby tree safe from the hounds. The fox tried all his tricks but the hounds out beat him. “My one trick is better than all his tricks”, said the cat to herself.

</strong></p>Orientasi : latar belakang cerita, menjelaskan orang-orang yang terlibat dalam cerita, kapan dan dimana cerita itu terjadi
Komplikasi : ketika permasalahan muncul dalam cerita
Resolusi : krisis atau masalah tersebut teratasi, untuk lebih baik atau lebih buruk.
Re-Orientasi : Opsional (tidak harus) boleh ada atau tidak ada.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unsur Kebahasaan:
</strong></p>Fokus pada satu tokoh atau pelaku dan biasanya individual sehingga biasanya menggunakan kata ganti (pronoun) seperti “I, we, she, he”.
Paling sering menggunakan past tense baik itu simple past tense, past continuous, maupun bentuk past tense lainnya.
Terkadang menggunakan dialog untuk mengajak pembaca berimajinasi sehingga ceritanya terlihat lebih jelas dan nyata (direct and indirect speech).
Karena berurutan (kronologis), maka biasanya juga menggunakan kata sambung (conjunction) agar cerita terlihat runtut atau urut.

</strong></p><p>The ant and The dove
</p><p>On a hot day of summer, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came near the river. To drink the water, she climbed up on a small rock. While trying to drink a water, she slipped and fell into the river.
</p><p>
</p><p>There was a dove sitting on a branch of a tree who saw an ant falling into the river. The dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the river near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She looked up to the tree and thanked the dove.
</p><p>
</p><p>Later, the same day, a bird catcher nearby was about to throw his net over the dove hoping to trap it. An ant saw him and guessed what he was about to do. The dove was resting and he had no idea about the bird catcher. An ant quickly bit him on the foot. Feeling the pain, the bird catcher dropped his net and let out a light scream. The dove noticed it and quickly flew away.

‘Well, maybe some day, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones,’ replied the fox airily.
Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder – the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. ‘This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,’ she called down to the fox. ‘Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?’
The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived. They fell upon the fox and tore her to pieces.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The Fox and the Grapes is one of the Aesop's fables, numbered 15 in the Perry Index. The narration is concise and subsequent retellings have often been equally so. The story concerns a  fox that tries to eat a grapes from a vine but cannot reach them. Rather than admit defeat, he states they are undesirable. The expression " sour grapes" originated from this fable.</p><br />
